# Production Database Migration Strategy

## Current State Analysis
- **Current Setup**: PostgreSQL running in Docker container
- **Risk Level**: HIGH - Data loss risk with `docker-compose down -v`
- **Backup Status**: No automated backup system detected

## Immediate Risk Mitigation (1-2 days)

### 1. Manual Backup Setup
```bash
# Create daily backup script
docker exec atis_postgres pg_dump -U atis_user atis_production > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Add to crontab for daily execution
0 2 * * * /path/to/backup-script.sh
```

### 2. Volume Protection
```yaml
# In docker-compose.prod.yml - ensure volumes are named and persistent
volumes:
  postgres_data:
    external: true  # Prevents accidental deletion
```

### 3. Database Monitoring
```bash
# Add health check to postgres service
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U atis_user -d atis_production"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
```

## Medium-term Strategy (1 week)

### Option 1: Keep Docker with Enhanced Safety
- Automated daily backups to external storage
- Database replication setup
- Monitoring and alerting system
- Regular backup restoration testing

### Option 2: Migrate to Managed Service (Recommended)
- AWS RDS PostgreSQL
- Azure Database for PostgreSQL
- Google Cloud SQL
- Benefits: Automated backups, scaling, monitoring, security patches

## Migration Steps (If choosing Option 2)

1. **Preparation**
   - Export current data: `pg_dump`
   - Test migration on staging environment
   - Update environment variables

2. **Migration Day**
   - Schedule maintenance window
   - Stop application services
   - Perform final data export
   - Import to managed service
   - Update connection strings
   - Test application functionality

3. **Post-Migration**
   - Monitor performance
   - Verify data integrity
   - Update backup procedures
   - Update documentation

## Rollback Plan
- Keep Docker database for 1 week after migration
- Have connection rollback procedure ready
- Test rollback process before migration

## Cost Estimation
- Managed PostgreSQL (AWS RDS): ~$50-200/month depending on size
- Current Docker setup: $0 but high operational risk
- Recommended: Start with smaller managed instance, scale as needed

## Decision Matrix
| Criteria | Docker + Safety | Managed Service |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Cost | Low | Medium |
| Operational Risk | Medium | Low |
| Scalability | Limited | High |
| Maintenance | High | Low |
| Backup Reliability | Manual | Automated |

## Recommendation
For production education management system with sensitive data:
**Choose Managed Service** - The operational safety and automated features outweigh the additional cost.
